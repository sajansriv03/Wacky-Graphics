## How Multiplayer Works:
- **Same Computer**: Open link in multiple browser tabs
  - Tab 1 = Player 1
  - Tab 2 = Player 2
  - etc.
- **Different Computers**: Each person opens the link in their own browser
  - NOTE: Current version uses localStorage, so each device has its own game state
  - To play across devices, all players must be on the same device (different tabs)

## Tips:
✅ Use Chrome or Firefox for best results
✅ Keep all tabs open while playing
✅ Don't refresh mid-game
✅ Game auto-saves in browser

## Troubleshooting:

**404 Error?**
- Make sure vercel.json is uploaded

**Build Failed?**

- Verify all files uploaded correctly

**Game Won't Start?**
